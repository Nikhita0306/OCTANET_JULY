    <h1>Some Cool Stories</h1>
    <h2 id="header1">The Eiffel Tower's Secret Apartment:</h2>
    <div class="flex-columns1">
        <p>When the Eiffel Tower was first built for the 1889 World's Fair, 
        Gustave Eiffel, the tower's engineer, had a private apartment on 
        its top floor. It was a hidden retreat where he entertained 
        esteemed guests, including Thomas Edison. Today, the apartment 
        is open to the public and offers a glimpse into the tower's history.</p>

    <h2 id="header2">The Phantom of the Opera:</h2>
    <div class="flex-columns2">
        <p>The iconic Palais Garnier opera house in Paris served as the inspiration
           for Gaston Leroux's famous novel "The Phantom of the Opera." 
           The story revolves around a mysterious figure who haunted the opera 
           house's underground passages. Though the character is fictional, 
           the opera house's underground lake, which still exists, adds an air 
           of intrigue to the tale.</p>

    <h2 id="header3">The Louvre's Glass Pyramid:</h2>
    <div class="flex-columns3">
        <p>The Louvre Museum is home to a modern architectural wonder—the glass 
            pyramid. Designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei, the pyramid 
            caused controversy when it was unveiled in 1989. Critics argued that 
            it clashed with the museum's historic surroundings, but over time, 
            it has become an iconic symbol of the Louvre and a beloved Parisian landmark.</p>

    <h2 id="header4">The Love Lock Bridge: </h2>
    <div class="flex-columns4">
        <p>For many years, the Pont des Arts bridge was adorned with thousands 
            of love locks—padlocks left by couples as a symbol of their eternal love. 
            However, in 2015, the weight of the locks became too heavy, causing part 
            of the bridge to collapse. The locks were removed, but the tradition continues 
            in other parts of the city, albeit without damaging the bridges.</p>

    <h2 id="header5">The Catacombs of Paris:</h2>
    <div class="flex-columns5">
        <p>Beneath the streets of Paris lies an eerie underground world known as the Catacombs. 
            In the late 18th century, due to overcrowded cemeteries, the remains of 
            approximately six million Parisians were transferred to the underground 
            ossuary. Today, visitors can explore a small section of these tunnels,
             walking among neatly arranged skulls and bones.</p>
